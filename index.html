    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Megan Zhang and I am currently a rising senior in high school. Some of my hobbies
        include swimming, hiking, working out, drawing, and anything that has to do with traveling. Some places that I
        woud like to go to in the future are Europe and Japan.</p>
    <p>This is my second or third website that I have created so far and I am excited to learn more in the near future.
    </p>

    <p>I am excited for the next few weeks at Northwestern's very own high school coding camp!</p>
