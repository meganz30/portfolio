    <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Index.html</a>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>As I mentioned before, some things that I like to do in my free time is swimming. I have been swimming since I
        was 4 so I am not scared of the water. I am currently on my school's varsity swim team and I couldnt be happier.
        I also a swim instructor at my city's local water park where I teach children from 9 months all the way to 10
        years old.</p>
    <h3>My Career Goals</h3>
    <p>After I graduate highschool, I am planning to go to college and pursue a computer science degree. After that I
        want to go on to my masters. If everything goes well, hopefully I will be working at a Fortune 500 tech company
        somewhere in Sillicon Valley or all the way in the East Coast.</p>
